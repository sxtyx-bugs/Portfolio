Create a personal website for me (Satyajit Patil). The website should feel clean, minimalistic, sketch-artistic, and entirely in black & white (no colors). Think of it as a modern portfolio that looks like hand-drawn art, with simple lines, light shadows, and a notebook/sketch vibe.

Structure & Sections:

Homepage (Introduction)

A large handwritten/sketch-style headline: “Hi, I’m Satyajit.”

A small sketch-style portrait placeholder or outline (black & white).

A one-line tagline about me: “Dreamer. Builder. Achiever.”

Minimal animated doodles (arrows, stars, underline effects).

About Me

A short description of who I am.

Mention my interests in AI, technology, OSINT, geolocation, building apps, and creating unique projects.

Add a timeline sketch of my journey (like milestones in doodle format).

Achievements

A list of awards and accomplishments in a sketchy notebook style (bullet points with doodles like trophies, stars, or medals).

Example placeholders:

“Won academic awards”

“Built AI-powered apps like LensAI, Inforvi”

“Created unique projects like ORLON.OG (geolocation-based site)”

“Top scores in Computer Science and JEE prep dedication”

“Fluent in Python, web building, AI experiments”

Hobbies & Interests

Presented in a grid or doodle icons format.

Include: Coding, exploring AI, OSINT/geolocation, writing creative notes, learning Japanese, traveling, creating faceless brands, and building projects.

Gallery / Showcase

A section to display screenshots/sketch cards of my projects like LensAI, Inforvi, ORLON.OG, Badlapur Bites, etc.

Each project card should have a sketch border with title + small description.

Quotes & Personal Touch

A section with my personal mottos or quotes in handwriting font.

Example: “Willing to do anything to become the best in AI programming.”

Example: “Together and forever with my goals.”

Contact / Links

Simple icons (black & white hand-drawn style) for Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn, Notion.

A sketch of an envelope for email.

Design Style:

Black & White only.

Use sketch/doodle style fonts, handwritten headlines, thin lines.

Minimal, lots of white space.

Soft hover effects (underline sketch when hovered).

Feels like a personal notebook turned into a digital site.
